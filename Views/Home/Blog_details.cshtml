                            Tanjiro Kamado is a kind-hearted and intelligent boy who lives
                            with his family in the mountains. He became his family's
                            breadwinner after his father's death, traveling to the nearby
                            village to sell charcoal. Everything changed when he came home
                            one day to discover his family was attacked and slaughtered by
                            a demon. Tanjiro and his sister Nezuko were the sole survivors
                            of the incident, with Nezuko being transformed into a demon,
                            but still surprisingly showing signs of human emotion and
                            thought. After an encounter with Giyū Tomioka, the Water Hashira
                            of the Demon Slayer Corps, Tanjiro is recruited by Giyū and sent
                            to his retired master Sakonji Urokodaki for training to also
                            become a Demon Slayer, beginning his quest to help his sister
                            turn into a human again and avenge the death of his family.

                            The Seven Deadly Sins are a band of knights in the land of
                            Britannia (ブリタニア, Buritania) who had disbanded ten years
                            earlier after being framed for plotting a coup of the Liones
                            Kingdom (リオネス王国, Rionesu Ōkoku), the Holy Knights who
                            sequestered them before taking control in the wake of a
                            rebellion they organized. Liones' third princess, Elizabeth Liones
                            , finds the Seven Deadly Sins' leader-Meliodas, before they search
                            out his comrades so they can clear their names and liberate Liones
                            from the Holy Knights, who were manipulated by a demon named
                            Fraudrin into unsealing the Demon Race from their prison.

                            The story follows the investigations of Narihisago, a renowned
                            detective now in prison, who is tasked with diving into the id
                            wells of various serial killers. Two years prior to the current
                            events, Narihisago's daughter Muku was brutally murdered by a 
                            serial killer, leading Narihisago's wife to commit suicide. 
                            These deaths prompted him to hunt down and murder the killer, 
                            earning him his prison sentence. He is still depressed and 
                            haunted by his wife and daughter's deaths, but also uses this
                            as motivation to take his work seriously and help stop serial
                            killers; however, as a result of the deaths of his family, he
                            bears a grudge against all serial killers, which occasionally
                            manifests as an uncontrollable urge to kill. Despite this, however,
                            it is shown that the majority of Narihisago's colleagues have great
                            respect for his work. Rookie field analyst Hondomachi becomes an
                            important character during the series after having a brush with
                            death in a serial killer case.
